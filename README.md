# React WYSIWEG Editor with PDF Dowloader

This is a test assignemnt. Follow the following instructions once repository has been cloned with the folowing command

### `git clone https://github.com/zainabbas86/react-editor.git`

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Note this Code is not production ready.
It will be good to have webpack when getting it ready for prod. Unfortunately I don't have enough time left to get webpack configured.
It would also be nice to add some tests.
Also I couldn't create a second page for document list selection due to time constraints. Hopefully the work I have done will demonstrate my skill in React which is a new programing platform for me.

It would have been very simple to do it in PHP (even without Symfony or any other frameworks) but that would not have been a challenge.
